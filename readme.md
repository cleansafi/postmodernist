# Postmodernist V.0.1 #
by Rodrigo Galindez and Alex Andrews

Thanks for downloading!

Modernist is a flexible, minimal theme focused on great typography. An invisible design to let you and your users focus on your content. Based on the design ideas of Jan Tschichold, Josef MŸller-Brockmann, Dieter Rams, and other modernists. Supports widgets, SEO optimized, clean and documented code, fast to load, WordPress 3.0.1 tested. Works in IE 6 & superior and all versions of Safari/Firefox/Opera. Includes CSS3 buttons.

Postmodernist is an adaption of that theme to the [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/), with additional bells and whistles for the homepage of [Alex Andrews](http://alexandrews.info). The name Postmodernist refers to the relation between this theme and the Modernist theme, and does not reflect the relation of modernism to postmodernism!

Postmodernist is WordPress 3.0.1 ready, and it will work in older versions too.
